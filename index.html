        <h2>Aaliyah</h2>
        <p>It's been a long time<br>
            We shouldn't have left you<br>
            Without a dope beat to step to<br>
            Step to, step to, step to<br>
            Step to, step to<br>
            Freaky-freaky<br>
            It's been a long time<br>
            We shouldn't have left you<br>
            Without a dope beat to step to<br>
            Step to, step to, step to<br>
            Step to, step to<br>
            Freaky-freaky, baby girl uh</p>
            
               
            <p>And if at first you don't succeed<br>
            Then dust yourself off and try again<br>
            You can dust it off and try again, try again<br>
            Cause if at first you don't succeed<br>
            You can dust it off and try again<br>
            Dust yourself off and try again, try again (and again)</p>
            
            <p>[Aaliyah]<br>
            I'm in to you<br>
            You into me<br>
            But I can't let it go<br>
            So easily<br>
            Not till I see<br>
            Whether this could be<br>
            Could be eternally<br>
            Or just a week<br>
            Ay yo our chemistry<br>
            Is off the chain<br>
            It's perfect now<br>
            But will it change?<br>
            This ain't a yes<br>
            This ain't a no<br>
            Just do your thing<br>
            We'll see how it go, oh, oh</p>
            
            <p class="add">[Repeat 1]</p>
            
            <p>[Aaliyah]<br>
            See you don't wanna throw it all away<br>
            I might be shy on the first date<br>
            What about the next date?<br>
            Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh?<br>
            I said you don't wanna throw it all away<br>
            I might be buggin' on the first date<br>
            What about the next date?<br>
            Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh?</p>
            
           <p class="add">[Repeat 1 (2x)]</p>
            
            <p>[Aaliyah]<br>
            If at first you don't succeed<br>
            You can dust it off and try again<br>
            Dust yourself off and try again, try again<br>
            Cause if at first you don't succeed<br>
            You can dust it off and try again<br>

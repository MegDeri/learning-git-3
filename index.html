        <h1>"Try again"</h1>
        <h2>Aaliyah</h2>
        <p>It's been a long time
            We shouldn't have left you
            Without a dope beat to step to
            Step to, step to, step to
            Step to, step to
            Freaky-freaky
            It's been a long time
            We shouldn't have left you
            Without a dope beat to step to
            Step to, step to, step to
            Step to, step to
            Freaky-freaky, baby girl uh
            
            [Aaliyah]
            What would you do?
            To get to me
            What would you say?
            To have your way
            Would you give up?
            Or try again
            If I hesitated
            To let you in
            Now would you be yourself
            Or play your role
            Tell all the boys
            I keep you low
            If I saw no
            Would you turn away?
            Or play me off
            Or would you stay, oh, oh..
               
            [1] - And if at first you don't succeed
            Then dust yourself off and try again
            You can dust it off and try again, try again
            Cause if at first you don't succeed
            You can dust it off and try again
            Dust yourself off and try again, try again (and again)
            
            [Aaliyah]
            I'm in to you
            You into me
            But I can't let it go
            So easily
            Not till I see
            Whether this could be
            Could be eternally
            Or just a week
            Ay yo our chemistry
            Is off the chain
            It's perfect now
            But will it change?
            This ain't a yes
            This ain't a no
            Just do your thing
            We'll see how it go, oh, oh
            
            [Repeat 1]
            
            [Aaliyah]
            See you don't wanna throw it all away
            I might be shy on the first date
            What about the next date?
            Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh?
            I said you don't wanna throw it all away
            I might be buggin' on the first date
            What about the next date?
            Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh?
            
            [Repeat 1 (2x)]

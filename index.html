        <p>It's been a long time
            We shouldn't have left you
            Without a dope beat to step to
            Step to, step to, step to
            Step to, step to
            Freaky-freaky
            It's been a long time
            We shouldn't have left you
            Without a dope beat to step to
            Step to, step to, step to
            Step to, step to
            Freaky-freaky, baby girl uh
            
            [Aaliyah]
            What would you do?
            To get to me
            What would you say?
            To have your way
            Would you give up?
            Or try again
            If I hesitated
            To let you in
            Now would you be yourself
            Or play your role
            Tell all the boys
            I keep you low
            If I saw no
            Would you turn away?
            Or play me off
            Or would you stay, oh, oh..
        </p>
